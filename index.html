<p>Life is a journey
You are never dealt the hand you desire.
You will come up against obstacles that are tough<br/>
Questions that cannot be answered or
A Relationships you will have problems in
Your <br/>heart will beat, you will sweat
You will cry your eyes out , and
You will quit, <br/>and try again
Everything obstacle you see in life is achievable
you must overcome the obstacles that are in you.<br/>
To overcome yourself is the key to
Happiness. </p>
